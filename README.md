## Architecture

This application follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern:

- **Model**: Data classes for Vehicle, Customer, Rental, and MaintenanceRecord
- **View**: Flutter UI components and screens
- **ViewModel**: BLoC (Business Logic Component) classes for state management

### State Management
- Uses **Cubit** from the `flutter_bloc` package
- Separate BLoCs for Vehicles, Customers, and Rentals
- Reactive UI updates based on state changes

### Data Storage
- **100% Offline**: All data stored locally on the user's machine
- **File-based Storage**: JSON files organized in dedicated folders
- **Data Location**: `rentcardata` folder in application support directory
- **No Authentication Required**: Direct access based on local machine permissions

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter 3.10+
- **Language**: Dart 3.0+
- **State Management**: flutter_bloc (Cubit)
- **Data Serialization**: dart:convert (JSON)
- **File System**: path_provider, dart:io
- **Calendar Widget**: table_calendar
- **UI Components**: Material Design 3

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.10.0 or higher
- Dart SDK 3.0.0 or higher
- Windows, macOS, or Linux for desktop support

flutter build windows
```

**macOS:**
```bash
flutter build macos
```

**Linux:**
```bash
flutter build linux
```

## Data Storage Structure

The application creates a `rentcardata` folder in the system's application support directory:

```
rentcardata/
â”œâ”€â”€ vehicles/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vehicle_id_1.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vehicle_id_2.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ customers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ customer_id_1.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ customer_id_2.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ rentals/
    â”œâ”€â”€ rental_id_1.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ rental_id_2.json
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each entity is stored as a separate JSON file with a unique ID, ensuring data integrity and easy backup/restore operations.
